# To check if two values are the same, we can use the equality operator: == 
# To check if two values are different, we can use the inequality operator: !=
# To check if one value is greater than another, we can use the greater than operator: >
# To check if one value is less than another, we can use the less than operator: <
# To check if one value is greater than or equal to another, we can use the greater than or equal to operator: >=
# To check if one value is less than or equal to another, we can use the less than or equal to operator: <=

# a == b # a is equal to b
# a != b # a is not equal to b
# a > b # a is greater than b
# a < b # a is less than b
# a >= b # a is greater than or equal to b
